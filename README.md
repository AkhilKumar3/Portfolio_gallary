## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Portfolio Gallery project! This is a simple web-based project where you can explore a collection of images showcasing various projects, artwork, photography, or design work. The project is built using HTML, CSS.

Image Grid: Images are displayed in a neat, grid-based layout for easy browsing.
Transition View: Clicking on an image it will move from bottom to center which makes it attractive.
Hover Effects: Hovering over images shows some interactive effects, making the gallery more engaging.
Custom Styling: The gallery uses custom styles to provide a clean and professional look.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure of the web page.
CSS: For styling the layout, hover effects, and responsive design.
